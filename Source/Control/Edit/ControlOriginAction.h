 * contents it puts back.
 *
 * undo() runs the inner actions in reverse order and redo() in order, as OpenTune would run them one by one.
 * An inner action is skipped once a later change without an undo entry (content.setKey, content.autoTune in
 * mode notesOnly) changed the aspect of the content it puts back: such a change is never taken back, so the
 * entry leaves that aspect as the later change set it (section 15.3 rule 9).
 *
 * The entry registers itself with the instance's ControlHistory for as long as it exists. OpenTune's
 * UndoManager owns it and destroys it when it leaves the history; the entry keeps the history alive through
 * a shared pointer, because the processor destroys its UndoManager after its control service.
 *
 * Threading: message thread only, like the UndoManager.

 * What the control API knows about OpenTune's undo history beyond the UndoManager (PROTOCOL.md section
 * 15.3): the undoIds it hands out, the entries it recorded (each ControlOriginAction registers itself), and
 * the undoIds it assigned to entries created in the OpenTune UI when edit.undo or edit.redo applied them
 * (rule 8).
 *
 * An entry of the UI is recognised by its object, its class, its description and its position in the
 * history. OpenTune's history has no identity of its own for entries; if the user discards such an entry
 * in the UI and makes the same kind of edit at the same position, the new entry can take the old one's
 * place in memory and would carry its undoId. Opening a project forgets all of them (the content epoch
 * changes and OpenTune clears its history).
 *
 * A full history moves every position: once it holds kUndoHistoryCapacity entries, UndoManager::addAction()
 * drops the oldest one and every entry moves down by one, and the read hooks cannot tell that apart from an
 * undo followed by a new entry. Whenever the history is found full and changed since it was last observed,
 * the undoIds of UI entries are therefore forgotten: such an entry is never confirmed at a position that may
 * hold another entry, and a call that names it fails with UNDO_CONFLICT(top_mismatch) instead. Steps the API
 * applies itself (noteOwnStep) move no position and keep them.
 *
 * Threading: message thread only. Owned by ControlService and shared with every ControlOriginAction.
