 * The methods of OpenTune's undo history (capability history.v1, PROTOCOL.md section 15.3), on the message
 * thread, through OpenTune's UndoManager (the processor's only instance, which the UI uses too) and its
 * read hook (peekUndo, peekRedo, size, cursor):
 * - edit.getHistory (methods/edit.getHistory.schema.json): the tops of the undo and redo histories with
 *   their undoId, description, origin and whether edit.undo and edit.redo would refuse them.
 * - edit.undo and edit.redo (methods/edit.undo.schema.json, methods/edit.redo.schema.json): apply the top
 *   entry when it is the one the client names (expectedUndoId), or whatever it is with force. A clip split,
 *   merge or delete on top is refused (UNSUPPORTED(undo_unsafe_build)), also with force. The step is
 *   applied with UndoManager::undo() / redo(), exactly as the UI's Ctrl+Z applies it; then the project is
 *   marked as changed and the editor refreshes as after its own undo (ControlUiBridge::onUndoRedoApplied(),
 *   the editor's afterUndoRedo()). The result describes the effect from snapshots before and after the step
 *   (controlDescribeEffect); a step that changed nothing is a success with noOp and UNDO_NO_EFFECT.
 *
 * Track deletion barriers (possiblyStale, UNDO_CONFLICT(stale_entry), UNDO_ENTRY_POSSIBLY_STALE) arrive with
 * the track methods; until then no entry is possibly stale.
